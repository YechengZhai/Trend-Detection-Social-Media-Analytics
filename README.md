# Trend-Detection-Social-Media-Analytics
Detecting emerging trends of food consumption from social media data (Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015)

# Project Background
Early detection of emerging food trends can translate into great business opportunities.

# Data
Over 4 million Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015;
We used a loosely constructed lexicon for terms that might be related to food to search related Facebook pages.

# Method
Construct time series of potential food trends and detect changes in those time series;
First create a monthly index for a hypothetical trend and then plot how such an index evolves over time;

# Validation
Use some ground truth to test the effectiveness of a proposed method.
